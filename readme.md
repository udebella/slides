# Slides

## Introduction

This repository aims to group all slides used for presentations inside the same repository and give easy 
access to them : only need a web browser.

## Contribute

To add new slides, you need to create a new markdown file inside [slides](./slides) folder.  
If you want to visualize the slide before commiting :
* Use `npm run reveal` command to generate the `_static` folder with static html site.
* Use [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) to 
visualize your slides while editing them

Github ci automatically generate the static site and deploys it to [github-pages](https://udebella.github.io/slides/)
